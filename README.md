## Rules

1. Must write atleast one paragraph.
2. Tutorials cannot be copied verbatim from any other source but can be the same as other sources. For example "How to write your first react component" that's a tutorial that thousands of sites have but as long as it's not copied exactly like another site it's ok to create.
3. All authors must use your full name to give credit and accountability of who wrote the article.

4. Users must upload a photo of themeselves.

5. All articles have to be written in markdown
